Included are several tables in sgrid's EoS_tab1d format
-------------------------------------------------------

dd2.txt sfho.txt sly4.txt  have been converted with ConvertEOSTab.py from
dd2.eos sfho.eos sly4.eos, which in turn were sent to WT by Seba. Seba calls
them LORENE tables.

SLy_PwPcold.txt has been generated by sgrid's EoS_T0 from the default
piecewise polytrope SLy EoS.

For some reason the epsl in sly4.txt and SLy_PwPcold.txt do not agree. This
is espicially visible in a log-plot for rho0 < 1e-3. Maybe sly4.eos and thus
sly4.txt are wrong???

In BAM/src/projects/eos/tab/tab1D/ there are also
eos_sly4.d eos_slyfit.d eos_sly_hpsfit_2048.d eos_sly_hpsfit.d
eos_sly_shibfit_2048.d
They can all be converted with ConvertEOSTab.py to sgrid's EoS_tab1d format.
All of them have much higher epsl than sly4.txt for rho0 < 1e-3.

The sgrid project MultiEoS also has a EoS_tab1d dir, with sly4_compose.txt
in it. sly4_compose.txt is converted from the more well-behaved table from
the CompOSE database. sly4_compose.txt agrees quite well with 
eos_sly4.txt eos_slyfit.txt eos_sly_hpsfit_2048.txt eos_sly_hpsfit.txt
eos_sly_shibfit_2048.txt
